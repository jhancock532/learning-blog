WOFF2 over TTF.

The last CSS rule is the one that's used for DOM styling, e.g.

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}

h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

This is why utilities are imported last in SCSS.

All fonts should be defined in REM for scaling relative to the font size set in `html`, and they should use relative line height values:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  line-height: 1.35; /* no unit */
}
```

`aria-level` shouldn't be used where `h1 - h6` is possible.
Don't include redundant information with the `aria-label` - e.g. `<nav ... aria-label="navigation">`

The name of a form element is the query parameter added to the form submission URL.
