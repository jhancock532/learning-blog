Remember to rebase to master before submitting a MR for review - we've now set this up as mandatory before merging, which is a nice feature to ensure the project is always in a "ready to go live" state if we want to make releases.

Gave presentation of an MVP to the design team, good feedback. Agreed goals for end of quarter, we're happy with actions set. Leading on an internal project there's a desire to get lots done but it's important to be realistic. Good practice for chairing meetings, setting agendas, following up with actions.

Sometimes the most obvious solution for clipping content is overlooked: why use clip-path, when you can use the container div and `overflow: hidden;`? Used to a cool card hover effect on https://www.baianat.com/, they also have an interesting card content loading animation on page load - a wave moving right to reveal what's hidden.

Chrome has a cool animation playback gif in the animations panel, I wonder if there is a way to save this for reference?
