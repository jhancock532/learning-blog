question: "What useful observations and logs from my work can I share with others?"
categories: weekend

Welcome to this new Jekyll site! After passing probation, I started taking daily learning logs covering the variety of work I performed as a Junior Developer at Torchbox. I hope that here I can share everyday learnings and give good insight to others the typical work of a FE developer.

I will start copying up my notes from the past month, with the aim of continuing to build this site up gradually as an extra-cirricular project - it should also help keep me focused on what I'm learning well, and other areas I have further skills to develop.

### TODO

- Set up tag filter pages
- Set up code snippet highlights
- Add nice styles - (design a generative background?), finish mixin setup
- Copy up the best notes from the past month
- Gradually buid this repo with daily notes :)
