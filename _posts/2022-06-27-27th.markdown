Whenever you're adding code to an existing component, consider whether it needs refactoring or tweaking: if you were to code review this work now, what would you change? This is important to remember as older code may have been written informally as a placeholder and not received as strict of a review as expected.

TIL what a docstring is - I've always added comments before, even though these are often removed at runtime.

From Wikipedia: [a string literal specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring)

VSCode collapse all to certain level: CMD + K, CMD + 1, 2, 3 ... Number depending on level of nesting you'd like to collapse to.
