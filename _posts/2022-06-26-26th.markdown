Adding USWDS components, updating the Apollo mocks and GraphQL queries. A fun new addition added to the resolvers to mimic breadcrumb heirarchy.

Added unit tests and e2e tests with this mock data.

Implemented array.reducer functions for my code; good practice for avoiding for loops, although I'm not sure if it's always more legible and understandable for other developers. Sometimes simple works best.

Refreshed my knowledge on array prototypes. `every` (if all true), `some` (if some true), `filter` (if meets condition), `find` (first for condition), `includes` (a misspelling of contains)`map` (one to the other), `flatMap` (map with [array, squished])`, `reduce` (accumulator fun!).

Rest ... grabs the rest of the params and encloses them into an array - can also be used while destructuring.

Spread ... converts iterables into individual objects.
