After passing probation, I started taking daily learning logs covering the variety of work I performed as a Junior Developer at Torchbox. I hope that here I can share everyday learnings and give good insight on the typical work of a FE developer.

TODO

- Set up tag filter pages
- Set up code snippet highlights
- Add nice styles - (design a generative background?), finish mixin setup
- Copy up the best notes from the past month
- Gradually buid this repo with daily notes :)
